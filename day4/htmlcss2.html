        ABOUT SATAN
    </h2>
    <p style="font-weight: normal; font-family: sans-serif;">
        In the first chapter of Job, Satan has seemingly crashed a party with God and his angels. Of course God doesn’t
        seem bothered. Instead he starts bragging on Job. Do you see how great Job is? Do you see how he respects me and
        turns away from evil? God asks. (I love that God is bragging on Job here. It really gives us some motivation.)
        The devil argues that of course he is faithful to God because God has placed a hedge around him. Job has never
        had a reason to doubt God. Do you see what is going here? Satan is paying attention. He knows who Job is. He
        knows all about Job.

    <h3>
        Satanism
    </h3>
    <P>
        Satanism is a modern, largely non-theistic religion based on literary, artistic and philosophical
        interpretations of the central figure of evil. It wasn’t until the 1960s that an official Satanic church was
        formed by Anton LaVey.
